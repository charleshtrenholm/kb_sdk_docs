Manually building the SDK
==========================

.. warning::

    The recommended installation option is to run the |container_link|.


Java JDK 8
'''''''''''

|oracle_link|

After downloading and installing the JDK, set your ``JAVA_HOME``
environment variable to point to your JDK installation. If you're not
sure where that is, on a Mac, the command ``/usr/libexec/java_home``
should tell you and on Linux, ``readlink -f $(which javac)`` will provide
the installed location of the javac, which you can use to find the base
directory of the installation. On a Mac you can set the variable like so:

::

    # for bash
    export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`
    # for tcsh/csh
    setenv JAVA_HOME `/usr/libexec/java_home`

You should probably add this command to the end of your
``~/.bash_profile`` or ``~/.bashrc`` file so it is always set when you start
a terminal.

Apache Ant
''''''''''

|ant_link|

|antapache_link|

The easiest way to install Ant on a Mac is probably to use a package
manager like |brew_link| , which allows you to install
simply by ``brew install ant``. Make sure the Ant install location is
added to your PATH environment variable, which is generally handled for
you if you use a package manager like HomeBrew.

Fetch the code from GitHub:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a directory in which you want to work. All your work should go
here. All commands that follow are assuming you are using a UNIX shell.

::

    cd <working_dir>
    git clone https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk
    cd kb_sdk
    make bin  # or "make" to compile from scratch

You should now have the kb-sdk program built in kb\_sdk/bin. It will be
helpful to add this to your execution path. From within the kb\_sdk
directory, you can run in Bash:

::

    export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH

Optionally, you can also install command completion with:

::

    source src/sh/sdk-completion.sh

Like ``JAVA_HOME``, you should consider adding these last two commands
to your ``~/.bash_profile`` or ``~/.bashrc`` file so the SDK is always
available in the terminal with command completion.

Test installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make sure you have built and installed the SDK successfully, type ``kb-sdk help`` and ``kb-sdk version``. Check that the version matches that declared in the line in ``src/java/us/kbase/mobu/ModuleBuilder.java`` that looks like this:

::

    public static final String VERSION = "1.x.x";
